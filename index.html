		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following creative dataviz stories, and carefully consume it, both text and creative elements. Make sure you spend time fully with each element. Then, critique it. Below the instructions, you should write the name of the project inside an h3 tag, and write at least three paragraphs and insert them below inside three separate p tags. Don't forget to close your tags!</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these projects:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/" target="_blank">Women's pockets</a>, The Pudding</li>
			<li><a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-POLLUTION/01008173281/index.html" target="_blank">Pollution in Delhi</a>, Reuters Graphics</li>
			<li><a href="https://egyptbuildingcollapses.org/#" target="_blank">Building collapses in Egypt</a>, <a href="https://alternative-narratives-vis-archive.com/case_studies/egypt-building-collapses" target="_blank">Tactical Technology Collective</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-7464500a-6368-4029-aa41-ab94e0ee09fb" target="_blank">COVID deaths through sound</a>, BBC</li>
	
		</ul>
		<p>Answer <i>at least</i> the following questions, and be thorough and detailed in your responses: Where is the data from in this project, and what dataviz/graphics/visual elements are used? What do you think is the key message of this dataviz project? Describe the different ways in which this dataviz project is effective at conveying its key message. Mona Chalabi talks about her dataviz projects being visceral, or having to do with deep, internal feelings rather than the intellect, in order to be memorable -- in what ways do you feel this dataviz project was visceral?</p>

		<h3>COVID Deaths Through Sound</h3>

		<h3>This article and data visualization was made by the BBC. They got their data from Johns Hopkins University, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control gave data for China and for data before January 22. Government data is used for the UK and France. The article uses interactive, moving graphs to represent cases totals and death counts in each country and the world as a whole. The BBC asks the reader to imagine each country's case and death total as a flower, with cases as the stem of the flower and the petals as daily death totals. </h3>
		<h3>The key message of this project is to show its readers a different type of COVID data expression. The readers of this article have probably been bombarded with simple line graphs that, after seeing so many, are probably skipped over. This not only gives the reader a new perspective on the pandemic, but also one in which they can consume that data in a new and, for some, more interesting way. This dataviz project is effective in conveying this message through its creative visualization, with the flower as the whole COVID data which draws the reader in and keeps them intrigued, but is ineffective in that it can be confusing for the reader, and it may take them some extra time to understand it. </h3>
		<h3>This dataviz project was visceral in that the sound aspect of it makes the flower animation feel so much more real. Each bell toll represents a certain threshold in confirmed cases and the sound gets louder and louder as deaths due to COVID increase.  </h3>



		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following datasets -- one of which we've used in the past -- to create one, fully complete Datawrapper chart or map, that reflects at least one finding from this dataset. Insert it below the instructions inside an iframe tag.</p>
		<p>Attributes of a fully complete Datawrapper chart: Hed, subhed, data source, alt text, legend, byline, any notes about data limitations or details, any annotations that you feel help convey your finding(s). Remember: your finding should be reflected in either your hed or subhed, and an explanation of your data (where it's from, what it collects, etc.) should be reflected in the other. You must choose colors from a color palette generator; you may not use Datawrapper's default colors.</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these datasets:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAtkOoa15IdWrdgNc-3rSP6in--SX8m-/edit?rtpof=true" target="_blank">Active duty troops</a>, Stimson Center</li>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RZ235-x4KYuyA7xQX-flOP-N5uvweIMh9qPh4FN2fLo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">NY data</a>, Mapping The Gay Guide</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- Insert your iframe tag, with your embed code inside, here: -->
<iframe title="United States Active Troops per country in 2002" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-wg5ZU" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wg5ZU/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="424"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
  
  		
  		<p>When you're done with both parts of this homework, return to Blackboard assignment step #4, and follow the instructions to get this on your Github page.</p>
